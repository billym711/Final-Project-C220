# Project02 Space Shooter - Tankie Terror

This was our first project for MSCH-C220, a 2D space shooter game. Completed on 2/12/2022.

This is a short bullet hell/shoot-em-up game with 4 different levels, different enemy patterns, and a scoring system.

## References
I took some inspiration from bullet hells like Enter the Gungeon and Binding of Isaac for some enemy behaviors.

## Future Development
I would like to make separate win and loss screens in the future.
