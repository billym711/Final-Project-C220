# Sixty Seconds To Survive
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2022

## Theme
We thought about the theme as a situation in which your options are severely limited, you must find a solution within an allotted time, and your choices are made under pressure.

## Game Play
The goal is to survive the zombie apocalypse while collecting upgrades.
However, the getaway car will leave after sixty seconds, and if you don't make it there, your upgrades will end up useless.
WASD to move, space to shoot.

## Impediments
The hardest parts of development were balance and look.
Though the mechanics are simple, because the game has hard time limits, placement of zombies and upgrades was important to make the game fun.
Additionally, because time was so limited, look was generally a lower priority, but having custom sprites helped give our game its own "style".

## Future Development

More sound effects, better map backgrounds, and shaders would be nice to make the game more juicy.
